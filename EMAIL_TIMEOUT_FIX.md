# Email Timeout Fix for Production Environment

## Problem Description

The Instagram automation system was experiencing email timeout issues in production when sending approval emails. The error was:

```
Error: Connection timeout
code: 'ETIMEDOUT'
command: 'CONN'
```

This occurred specifically in the `sendApprovalEmail` method at line 44 of `emailService.js` during the daily automation process, but worked fine during manual job posting.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Different Email Flows**: 
   - Manual job posting uses `sendNotificationEmail()` and `sendJobPostSuccessNotification()`
   - Production automation uses `sendApprovalEmail()` which includes connection verification

2. **Production Environment Issues**:
   - Network restrictions/firewalls in production containers
   - Different DNS resolution
   - SMTP server connectivity issues
   - Container networking limitations
   - Connection verification timeout in production environment

3. **Timeout Configuration**: The original timeout settings were too aggressive for production environments

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Connection Verification

**Key Change**: Completely removed the unnecessary `verifyConnection()` step that was causing timeouts.

The connection verification step was:
- Not necessary for email sending
- Causing timeout issues in production
- Adding unnecessary complexity
- Slowing down the email process

### 2. Production-Optimized Timeout Settings

Updated the email service constructor to use different timeout settings based on environment:

```javascript
// Production-optimized timeout settings
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const connectionTimeout = isProduction ? 30000 : 60000; // 30s in production, 60s in dev
const greetingTimeout = isProduction ? 15000 : 30000;   // 15s in production, 30s in dev
const socketTimeout = isProduction ? 30000 : 60000;     // 30s in production, 60s in dev
```

### 3. Reduced Connection Pool Settings for Production

```javascript
maxConnections: isProduction ? 3 : 5,        // Fewer connections in production
maxMessages: 50,          // Reduced messages per connection
rateLimit: 3,             // Reduced rate limit for production
retryAttempts: 2,         // Fewer retry attempts in production
```

### 4. Simplified Email Sending

- Removed complex production-specific handling
- All email methods now use the same simplified approach
- Direct email sending without connection verification
- Maintained retry logic with transporter recreation as fallback

### 5. Enhanced Retry Logic

Updated `sendEmailWithRetry()` method to:

- Execute email function directly (no connection verification)
- Use faster retry intervals in production (3s vs 5s)
- Have fewer retry attempts in production (2 vs 3)
- Include transporter recreation for connection issues

## Key Changes Made

### File: `backend/services/emailService.js`

1. **Constructor**: Added production environment detection and optimized timeout settings
2. **sendApprovalEmail()**: Simplified to use standard retry logic
3. **sendEmailWithRetry()**: Removed connection verification step entirely
4. **verifyConnection()**: Removed this method completely
5. **sendApprovalEmailProduction()**: Removed this method (no longer needed)
6. **recreateTransporter()**: Updated to use production-optimized settings

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated Timeout Issues**: Removed the unnecessary connection verification that was causing timeouts
2. **Faster Email Sending**: Direct email sending without verification delays
3. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex production-specific handling
4. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with transporter recreation
5. **Environment-Specific Optimization**: Different settings for development vs production
6. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Fewer connections and retry attempts in production

## Testing

The fix has been designed to:
- Work in both development and production environments
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide better error messages and logging
- Handle network issues gracefully

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set in production environment
2. Monitor email sending logs for any remaining issues
3. The fix is backward compatible and doesn't require environment variable changes

## Expected Results

- Approval emails should now send successfully in production
- Faster email sending with reduced timeout issues
- Better error handling and logging
- Maintained functionality for manual job posting
